**DRAGONS PAGE** changes the exercices of the course **Amazon DynamoDB: Building NoSQL Database-Driven Applications**  https://www.coursera.org/learn/dynamodb-nosql-database-driven-apps/home/welcome to be done using the AWS CDK. Thanks to Seph Robinson, Morgan Willis and Rick H for the course. (I also recommend the specialization AWS Fundamentals: Going Cloud-Native that I did before.)

> This will help you to learn how to develop using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK).
